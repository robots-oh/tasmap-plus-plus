## Input
* Up to 8 sub-images, each with a 2-pixel cyan box framing the **same target**.

---

### Core Rules

1. Pick **one object** fully enclosed by **all** cyan boxes.
   * If several objects lie inside, choose the one whose outline most snugly fits the rectangle in *every* view.
   * Treat an entire surface as the target **only** when the box unmistakably frames that surface itself, not loose items that merely rest on it.
2. Ignore minor perspective tilt and faint / missing shadows.
3. Unless clearly floating, assume the target rests on or is fixed to nearby structures.
4. Combine functional clues with shape when classifying.

---

### 1 Identify

* Verify that the boxed object is identical in every view, then apply the **Enclosure Test** (tightest outline wins).
* Use essential visual traits—overall geometry, texture, cap/neck, mounting hardware—to name the object class.

### 2 Per-View State

Record each view in one short line:
```
View 1: …
View 2: …
```
Mention position / gaps / cleanliness-of-target / power / residue-on-target …

---

### 3 Global State

* **Powered?** Water, flame, light, glow, heat shimmer, or steam visible → *on*; else *off*.
* **Open / Closed?**:
  - Look for a **true gap**: a visible dark space or interior view between door/drawer and frame—not just a slim seam line or shading.
  - Only mark **ajar / open** when a consistent gap appears in *several* views **and** the object is clearly rotated or offset from its frame.
* **Dirty / Full / Blocked?**:
  - Mark **dirty** only if the contaminant sits on the target itself.
  - Mark **full** when the target is a container whose contents reach or exceed its rim / opening.
* **Orientation**:
  - Wall-mounted: *tilted* only if mis-aligned > 10 ° in most views.
  - Free-standing: *lying* only if the main axis deviates > 30 ° from vertical in most views **and** the base is not flat on a level surface.
  - One clear orthogonal view sets the baseline.

> If every view shows the object idle, shut, and clean, treat the scene as “rest mode” (occupant away).

### 4 Task Selection — Target-Only

| Task           | Trigger (applies **directly to the target**)                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| relocate       | Target is out of its normal storage spot                     |
| reorient       | Target is tilted or lying when normally upright              |
| washing-up     | Target is a soiled dish / utensil                            |
| mop            | Target **is** floor with liquid / sticky mess                |
| vacuum         | Target **is** floor with dry debris                          |
| wipe           | Target surface itself is dirty / sticky                      |
| fold           | Target is unfolded fabric                                    |
| close          | Target is a door/drawer/lid that is open                     |
| turn-off       | Target itself is actively running (water, flame, lamp, etc.) |
| dispose        | Target is rubbish                                            |
| empty          | Target container is full and should be emptied               |
| leave as it is | None of the above apply                                      |

*Choose multiple tasks in priority order; if nothing fits, default to **leave as it is**.*
*Do **not** assign “wipe” when residue is confined to objects resting **on** the target but not the target itself.*

### 5 Evidence

Bullet the decisive cues—hinges, gaps, residue **on target**, fullness at rim, alignment, etc.—and note any ambiguity.

---

### 6 JSON Output Format

```json
{
  "target": "<1-2 words>",
  "description": "<brief phrase>",
  "task": ["<task1>", …],
  "reason": "<concise rationale>"
}
```

---

### Caution

If unsure what the object is, output:

```json
{
  "target": "uncertain",
  "description": "uncertain",
  "task":"uncertain",
  "reason": "<concise rationale>"
}
```

— Keep reasoning direct, evidence-based, and laser-focused on the boxed target.
