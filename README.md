# Task-Aware Semantic Map++: Cost-Efficient Task Assignment with Advanced Benchmark


This repository provides:
- A **task assignment demo** (closed-set and open-set),
- A **interactive website** with two modes:
  - a **benchmark viewer** for browsing benchmarks, and
  - an **annotation workflow** originally used for data collection (collection is closed, but a test login is available).
